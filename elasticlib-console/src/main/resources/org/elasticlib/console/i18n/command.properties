set.summary=Set a config value
unset.summary=Unset a config value

#
# Contents
#
delete.summary=Delete an existing content
delete.description=Physically delete an existing content and remove it from search index. \
However, its metadata is not deleted and a new orphean metadata revision is even created \
(in order to enable replication of this deletion).

digest.summary=Compute actual hash and length of an existing content
digest.description=This command enables to check that an existing content has not been altered. \
It computes its current SHA-1 and length. \
Computed values should match those obtained from the content metadata (which are computed at creation).

find.summary=Search contents
find.description=Metadata of all contents in a repository is indexed. \
This command issues a search against the current repository index and retrieve relevant contents. \
It takes a Lucene search query as a parameter. \n\
\n\
Search fields (which can be auto-completed by typing <tab>) correspond to the metadata fields. \
When a search is issued without specifying a field, \
the default one is 'body' which corresponds to the content itself.

get.summary=Download an existing content
get.description=Download an existing content from current repository and save it in current working directory.

head.summary=Print head metadata revisions of a given content
head.description=Display the latest metadata revision of a given content. \
This command is close to 'revisions' but prune displayed revisions to the latest one(s). \
In case of a conflict, which can happen in the advent of concurrent replications, \
the latest revision may not be unique. In this case, all conflicting revisions are displayed.

history.summary=Print current repository history
history.description=All operations done on a repository are recorded (in particular, for replication purposes). \
This command displays this history, for the current repository. Each issued operation is recorded with:\n\
\n\
- A sequence number, which serves as an identifier.\n\
- Associated content and metadata revision SHA-1.\n\
- The operation type (a content creation, deletion or a metadata update).\n\
- A timestamp.

put.summary=Import content(s) in current repository
put.description=If supplied path points to a file, a new content is created in current repository from this file. \
If it points to a folder, a new content is created from each file in this folder and its sub-folders. \
For each file imported, the following happens:\n\
\n\
- A SHA-1 cryptographic hash of the content of the file is computed. \
It creates a long number that (in practice) uniquely identifies the file. \
It is used as the identifier of the content in the repository.\n\
\n\
- If a content with this hash is already stored in the repository, the process stops there, \
indicating that the content is already stored. Otherwise metadata is automatically extracted from the file.\n\
\n\
- The content of the file is then uploaded to the repository along with extracted metadata.

revisions.summary=Print all metadata revisions of a given content
revisions.description=List all metadata revisions of a given content, sorted by topogical order, \
from the latest to the oldest. \n\
\n\
See also related commands 'head' and 'tree'.

tree.summary=Print metadata revisions tree of a given content
tree.description=Display all metadata revisions of a given content as a tree, sorted by topological order. \
Compared to 'revisions' this allows to see if conflicting updates have happened, \
and how they have been resolved.

update.summary=Update info about an existing content
update.description=A repository content never changes (but can be deleted). \
In contrast, metadata associated with each content is versioned. \
When you create a content, a snapshot of associated metadata is stored along. \
Using the update command, you can modify this metadata. It will create a second revision. \
Each metadata revision is stamped with a SHA-1.\n\
\n\
The update command loads the current metadata revision of a given content in an editor of your choice. \
For this to be done, you have to define which editor to use in the configuration (see 'help @config'). \
If you modify opened revision, save and close the editor, a new revision is created.

# Misc
#
about.summary=Print info about this app
cd.summary=Change current working directory

#
# Node
#
connect.summary=Connect to a node
connect.description=Most commands are issued toward a given node. \
Therefore, you first have to connect to a node using this command. \
It takes the URI of the node as sole argument.\n\
\n\
Completion (by typing <tab>) may be used here to find nodes on the local network, \
which may be automatically discovered.\n\
\n\
Once successfully connected, the node name appears on the command prompt.

disconnect.summary=Disconnect from current node
disconnect.description=See also the 'connect' command.

leave.summary=Stop using current repository
leave.description=See also the 'use' command.

node.summary=Display info about current node
node.description=These info are:\n\
- Its name.\n\
- Its GUID, which is a ramdomly generated unique identifier.\n\
- Its publish URI(s), which are URIs to use to connect to this node.\n\
- Its repositories.

use.summary=Select repository to use
use.description=All contents related command are issued toward a given repository. \
Therefore, you first have to select which one with this command. \
It takes the name or the GUID of the repository as sole argument.\n\
\n\
Completion (using the <tab> key) may be used here to list existing repositories.\n\
\n\
Once successfully selected, the repository name appears on the command prompt.
